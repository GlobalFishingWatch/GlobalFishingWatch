              Hundreds of millions of people depend on the ocean for their livelihoods
              and many more rely on the ocean for
              food. However, the worldâ€™s oceans are threatened by global overfishing,
              illegal fishing and habitat destruction. Their
              sustainability depends on action by governments, fishery management
              organizations, citizens and the fishing industry itself.
