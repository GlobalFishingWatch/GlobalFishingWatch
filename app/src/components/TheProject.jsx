            Hundreds of millions of people depend on the ocean for their livelihoods
            and many more rely on the ocean for
            food. However, the worldâ€™s oceans are threatened by global overfishing,
            illegal fishing and habitat destruction. Their
            sustainability depends on action by governments, fishery management
            organizations, citizens and the fishing industry itself.
